## Setup Instructions

-Rename gitignore file to .gitignore
-Rename GitHub directory to .github to allow build automation via github actions
In the .github directory ensure that the development.json file is configured correctly
with the artifactId used in studio and the file name is correct for your project.

Rename your ExampleApp.java to what you'd like. After changing it ensure that the descriptor.json
file is configured correctly with the new class name and package.
